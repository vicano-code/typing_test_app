    "I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal'.\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. (By Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.)",
    "I am come amongst you, as you see, at this time, not for my recreation and disport, but being resolved, in the midst and heat of the battle, to live and die amongst you all; to lay down for my God, and for my kingdom, and my people, my honour and my blood, even in the dust. I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realm: To which rather than any dishonour shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field.\n --Queen Elizabeth I",
    "It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us; that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.\n --Abraham Lincoln",
    "And so, my fellow Americans: Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: Ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.\n --John F. Kennedy",
    "The value of love is what gives life meaning. It is what gives us the fortitude to endure hardship and the bravery to move on. We are all made of love. It is what ties us to other people and makes us feel like we belong.Our lives have meaning and purpose because of it. So let’s all work to love more intensely and completely. Let’s all strive to be kinder, more understanding, and more open to receiving and giving love. Let’s widen our hearts, take more chances, and be more accepting of the people around us. Keep in mind that love is a necessity, not a luxury. Without love, life is pointless and empty. Love makes life rich and complete. Love is the greatest present we can give to the world and to ourselves because it makes life worthwhile."
